Python API homework

homework submitted on 5/5/2021 by Stephen Peters

Written in Python, focusing on the use of API's.

The homework files can be found inside the WeatherPy and VacationPy directories.

Simple conclusions based on analysis of the data can be found in the Jupyter notebooks.

The output from the WeatherPy assignment can be found in that directory under "output_data".

In order to execute the Jupyter Notebooks the user will need to enter their API keys into the "api_keys.py" files in both directories.

This project requires the following Python libraries: matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, numpy, requests, gmaps, os, pprint, json, time, scipy.stats
